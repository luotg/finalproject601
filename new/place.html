				<h1>Halloween</h1>
				<article>
					<p>Halloween has just passed, but during this time, I attended an interesting event around Chicago. This is a farm. 
					In the farm, everyone can play in the haunted house they designed. In addition, there are many entertainment facilities. 
					You can also see piglets racing at the farm. This is a great place to do activities with kids now.</p>
