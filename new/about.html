				<h1>Before coming to USA</h1>
				<article>
					<p>Before coming to the United States, I lived in Shanghai, China. Currently my family are all in Shanghai. 
					I experienced my life from elementary school to high school in Shanghai. It was an unforgettable experience. 
					The weather in Shanghai is very warm, just like LA. As the largest city in China, Shanghai contains a variety 
					of cuisines and cultures from all over the world.</p>

				<h1>Life in the USA</h1>
				<article>
					<p>When I first came to the United States, I attended Central Michigan University for my undergraduate studies. 
					After graduating from CMU in 2019, I came to the University of Michigan to complete my graduate degree. After 
					graduating from the University of Michigan in 2021, I came to the Chicago area to work and live. 
					While working, I also chose to continue my studies at Boston University.

					<p>Chicago is different from Shanghai. The weather here is very cold. I had never seen snow in Shanghai, 
					but the heavy snow in Chicago opened my eyes to a new world. As the third largest city in the United States, 
					Chicago, like Shanghai, brings together all kinds of food from around the world. The Chicago Bulls are my favorite team too.
					I love living in Chicago.
